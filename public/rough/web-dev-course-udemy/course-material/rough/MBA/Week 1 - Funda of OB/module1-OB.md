Week 1 - Fundamentals of OB Notes:

# Video 1: Module Overview

- In a recent study by Fierce
Inc, 86% percent of corporate executives surveyed cited lack of educated
collaboration as a cause for workplace failure. In fact, in the same survey, it
was found that more than 97% of those surveyed believed the lack of
alignment within a team, which of course directly impacts the outcome of
any given task or project.
(Fierce Inc. , 2011)

skills needed for contemporary managers?
: ANS--> The ability to communicate
effectively, to collaborate, to lead, to manage, to motivate, to negotiate, to
influence, to persuade, to coach, to mentor, to train, to develop, to
facilitate, to manage conflict, to manage change, to manage stress, to
manage time, to manage meetings, to manage projects, to manage
performance, to manage diversity, to manage teams, to manage
relationships, to manage oneself, to manage others, to manage
technology, to manage the environment, to manage the organization.
(Stevens, 2009)

The result indicates that there is a huge discrepancy in the behavioural skills
that are needed to perform tasks efficiently and effectively at any workplace.

"There is an
essential human factor in every business endeavour.
It doesn't matter if you have a perfect product, production plan and
marketing pitch. You still need the right people to lead and implement
those plans."  -- Bill Gates

At a mid-level management especially, one thing that's really crucial is
tackling tricky behavioural issues. A mid-level manager basically acts as an
interface between the top and the low-level hierarchies at work. And
naturally, dealing with people day in day out becomes an integral part of
the job. Hence, for any manager, behavioural challenge weighs much more
than technical challenges.
### -- Need people skills

"organisational behaviour,
has many facets, is the study of how humans behave in organisational
settings"

Note that unless and until you understand your own
behaviour and your sensory cases, it's nearly impossible to manage and deal
with behavioural issues of others at work.

# Video 2: Introduction to Organisational Behaviour
DEFINE ORGANISATIONS: 
- A, two or more people work together. B, their tasks might be
done individually or done in groups, however, are some way or the other
intertwined and interdependent. And next, these people work towards a
common goal. This goal could be one or more. Note that, even though the
goals might not be fully agreed upon at times, this social entity will be called
as an organisation.
### -- Organisations are social entities
Behaviours are interaction between personality, attitude,
perceptions, values, motivations, emotions and so on.It also includes
characteristics of situational factors as well. Hence, they are function of
People Management
individuals' response to their environment.
### -- Behaviours are function of individuals' response to their environment
Organisational behaviours can be defined as a
multi-disciplinary field that seeks knowledge of behaviour in organisational
settings by systematically studying individuals, groups and organisational
processes. 

Under OB or people
management module, we shall assess behaviours at micro, meso and
macro-levels.

# Video 3: Characteristics of Organisational Behaviour
### -- Organisational Behaviour is a multi-disciplinary field
OB ASSUMPTIONS:
OB depends upon a lot of fundamental assumptions. I'll be taking you
through some of the important ones. The first one is that organisations work
in an open system.
### -- Organisations work in an open system
the economic,
political, environmental, social and technological factors strongly impact
the company's internal structures regularly.
### -- External factors impact internal structures
The second assumption is that organisations are social
systems. This means that organisations are made up of people who interact
with each other. And these interactions are governed by social norms and
values.

With changing external and internal business environment, it's
difficult to have one model or framework that explains everything.

--> psychology such as motivation, personality, emotions,
attitude and so on. It also borrowed topics from sociology such as decision-
making, group processes, team dynamics etc. It also borrowed topics from
anthropology such as organisational culture, climate, environment and so
on.
### -- OB is an amalgamation of various parallel fields of study

Organizational Behavior (OB) theorists have developed a number of frameworks to understand how people behave and function within organizations. These theories aren't about a one-size-fits-all approach, but rather offer insights into what might work best depending on the situation. Here are a couple of prominent examples:

Trait Theory: This theory focuses on the inherent qualities and personality traits of employees. It suggests that certain personality types are better suited for specific roles or leadership styles [1].
Motivational Theories: These theories delve into what drives and motivates employees. Understanding what motivates individuals or teams can help managers create a work environment that fosters productivity and satisfaction [1]. There are various motivational theories, like Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory which differentiates between hygiene factors (basic needs) and motivators (achievement, recognition).

# Video 4: Skills Needed for Contemporary Managers
How a mgr creates a competitive advantage in its organisation?
 --> current era, especially post-COVID
era, managers just don't have to monitor employees but also see what
they're doing and how they're feeling. 

Behavioural skills, for example, include the ability to work with
people, understand and motivate them.
So, you should be good with
negotiations, communication skills, conflict handling, emotional
intelligence and so on. Third, the conceptual skills, they include the ability
to analyse and diagnose complex situations.
Choosing best from the alternatives on hand and be able to evaluate them,
decision-making at a macro level, spot bottlenecks, offer solutions are some
of the important aspects of this skill

### Harvard review - 7 skills for managers (T)
Harvard article, which
articulates seven skills needed for managers to manage teams. Some of the
skills included emotional intelligence, clear communication, how
approachable you are or how open you are with the subordinates. These are
some of the most influential and highly needed skills currently.
### -- Managers need to be good at behavioural skills, conceptual skills and technical skills
A mid-level manager acts as an interface
### What would be the first few changes you would implement if you were hired or promoted at a managerial role? (T)

# Video 5: Organisational Challenges: Overview
 Example of - how covid hit big, mid and small size companies differently?
 (say in your own words) (T)
# Video 6: Organisational Challenges: Remote Work and Hybrid Systems
 - US saw a 125% increase in remote work usage
 - On an average, those who work from home spend 10
minutes less a day being unproductive, work one extra day a week, are 47%
more **productive**.
- Their **performance** is increased up to 13% by working from home.  (Stanford for 16k emp)
- workers also
reported improved work satisfaction and attrition rates were cut by 50% (Stanford)
- People feel flexibility as the key to increase in performance (Gartner - 10k digital employees)

- Gartner 2021, Digital Worker Experience Survey, 43% of respondents
said that flexibility in working hours helped them achieve greater
productivity and 30% of respondents said that less or no time commuting
enabled them to be more productive. By 2022, 25% of global knowledge
workforce will choose their home as primary workplace and 45% of the
workforce will be working from home 2-3 days per week as per the report. (Gartner., 2021 - Digital Worker Experience Survey)

### Problem statement for managers
idea of hybrid work environments, come some of the challenges
such as: How do we monitor our employees? Do managers need to watch
or monitor them more closely or with enough autonomy and flexibility? Let
them be on their own and trust them instead of controlling their routine?

**
And last but not the least, the challenge is around how they establish hybrid
setups and manage performances accordingly.
**

# Video 7: Organisational Challenges: Employee Engagement & Learning and Development

 the engagement of employees and
how to manage them has a new perspective altogether.
How to maintain the affiliation of employees with their employers is another
challenging task. The next in the line is focusing on mental health and well-
being of the employees. Further helping them reduce the spillover between
work and family and also extending support and care during the crisis to
them and their families. Besides this, there are some more challenges.
For example, polic*ies that are being made more flexible and accessible to
all, not just at the top level but also at a mid and lower level. So for example,
leadership addressing low and mid-level employees regularly with most
authenticity possibl*e should be some of the new parameters being included
engagement programs**.

**
Cross-functionality in this regard is relevant so that the others can step in
and get the job done when others are reluctant to turn up. So, to summarise
the challenge, in the era of digitisation and the increasing importance of
knowledge intensive jobs, managers need to upscale themselves and their
employees. Managers must motivate and incentivise their employees to
take up new tools, learn new technologies and increase their domain
knowledge to prepare them for the unforeseen.
**

# Video 8: Organisational Challenges: Managing Diversity and Inclusion
- Forbes recently published. The Survey
shows that one in three mothers, see their careers jeopardise because of
COVID-19.
- by ILO among the
blue collar segment, it's been found that 41% of women were employed in
sectors at high risk for jobs, or working our losses from the pandemic
compared with 35% of men.
**
Its coverage in terms of
different races, culture, sexual orientation, religion, class, gender, identity
differences. In the workplace, diversity means - your staff consist of
heterogeneous set of individuals who bring new perspectives and ideas to the table.
Inclusion means that the organisation is committed to creating a culture
where all employees feel valued and respected. Diversity and inclusion are
not just about the right thing to do, but it's also about the business case.
**
- HSBC introduced a Career Comeback
Programme for experienced professionals, both men and women to restart
their career after a break of 12 months or more.

### Think about how you can uplift people. How can you make them feel more inclusive and more belong to their workplace? (T)

# Video 9: Scientific Methods in Organisational Behaviour Research

Research methods in OB include: 5 mentioned here - 
survey methods, exploratory or qualitative studies, experimental or
manipulation-based studies, meta-analysis, observation-based techniques.

### Think of a scenario, where as a manager, you are trying to understand how safe your employees feel at work (T)
 By safe, I mean
to mention the treatment they receive from others, if they feel any sort of
discrimination or are they comfortable visiting their seniors' offices,
especially for one-on-one meetings? Are they comfortable wearing attires
whether it's ethnic or western, without having fear of being judged or
harassed or pinpointed? In such an investigation where you're trying to
understand emotional, physical and psychological safety of your employees,
which method of investigation would you follow? Think about it.

Organisational Behaviour is a vast subject area. Apart from the video lectures, urge you to go through the following resources to help gain insights and apply the concepts better to your activities.

Why are managers needed?
 tackkling tricky behavioural. issues
 dealing with people day in  - day out
 behavioural challenges vs technical challenges


 Q:
 The concept of OB feels empowering for a manager. Can you give an example of how these learnings can be applied in real world situation?
 From myunderstanding the cause could be anything - from an individual perspective or a group not performing well, and taking necesarry action as a manager?
 With the basis on evidence-based management:
 1. How do you define that they are not performing well? or even whether this problem is worth taking or not?
 2. How will you decide on next course of action?
 3. How will you measure if outcome has become better? 


 Are there any additional resources, readings, or websites you recommend to gain a deeper understanding of the foundational concepts?
 more practical knowledge?


 Focus on a specific point:  "In the reading about the OB model, there was a term called 'organizational culture.'  Can you elaborate on what this means and how it can impact employee behavior?"

Career Connection:  "As someone pursuing an MBA, how can a strong understanding of organizational behavior benefit me in my future career?"

Debate a concept: (If applicable) "The textbook discusses different leadership styles.  Is there a 'one size fits all' approach, or do successful managers adapt their style based on the situation?"

Connect to your background: (Optional) "Coming from a background in [your industry], I'm curious how some of these OB concepts might manifest differently in that context.  Do you have any insights?"

Explore the Professor's expertise: (If known) "I noticed you have research experience in [professor's research area].  Does any of that research tie back to the topics we'll be covering in this course?"

Hi Team,

I have some concerns with the latest "Quiz 1.4: Fundamentals of Organisational Behaviour" and would like to seek clarity in the below questions and their assigned answers:

Question 1:
The answer provided is "Poor collaboration between managers and employees". 

I believe the answer should be "Lack of adequate communication as a cause of workplace failures" as this is more relevant for this question as it covers the depth of the article in many key findings rather than the sub-title on the article, as, "Poor Communication Between Decision Makers and Employees" as a stand-alone statement. In my opinion, Option A is a sub-set of the option C which the article majorly covers in it. And, if the question "what does Fierce Inc Survey Data exposes:", then option A is weaker than Option C.
Here, option C is directly infered too - "86 percent of respondents blame lack of collaboration or ineffective communication for workplace failures" which stands correct.


Question 18:

I believe "all the options are relevant". To support, with my experience (and others) working through the pandemic, there is no areas untouched in these options where we hadn't focussed. Especially, lot of effort was put in to mitigate the risk and "ensuring safety of employees" and we all had to relearn
"communicating effectively" in our new remote setup as it effected our daily lives and interaction, morale, mental health etc., 

I don't see the reason, why these options are marked as incorrect for workforce challenges that orgs should focus on, as a lot of companies contitue investmenting across the industries.

Question 19:

Strictly checking it from the discussions and the learnings we had, option C does not relate to Open System. Equifinality refers to the idea that there can be multiple ways to achieve same goal. It's important for flexibility or adaptability of an Org, but it's not a sole defining characteristic of Open System.

I believe, option C (Only B) is the right answers.

Question 14:

Here, none of the options are complete statements to choose from. For instance, HR has a lot of data on hiring and it's "demography" related analytics, and can influence other depts easily as recruitment dept is part of HR (first POC for outside candidate and EPMs from team), which can easily coordinate the D&I initiative.

Hence, I don't see why "influence on various aspects of business" as the only correct option here. And would like to seek more clarity on this term (various aspects) and what it means here.

Out of these options, through my experience, I know many depts run their own D&I initiatives under a sponsorer. Yes, HR can help get the data and own company level metrics for measures due to their specific position in the company, but owning the single D&I initiative is sth I don't really agree with, as their impact is mostly closer to the teams and domains where it happens.

Hence, I believe, this question is really vague and would appeal to reconsider it.
