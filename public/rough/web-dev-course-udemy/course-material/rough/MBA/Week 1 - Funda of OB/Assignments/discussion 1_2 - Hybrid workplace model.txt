Subect: Proposal for Hybrid workplace policy

As you are aware, with the recent survey data, 80% of our colleagues has opted to return back to office. While full return is an option, a hybrid model offers the best of both the worlds, boosting productivity, better work-life balance, and open doors for more talent acquisition while remaining financially sound.

Address Employees Concerns:
- Hybrid offers benefits of remote-work days, incl. reduced commute times potentially leading to more flexiblity, and productive hours. According to Fierce Inc survey, an average of 13% higher productivity is realized across industries.
- Working few days can also provide much needed security for the mental health, as many of us are still not able to adjust to full time office hours.
- Hybrid also allows our managers to allocate someone to assist crew for some of the strategic projects

Financial Benefits:
- Hybrid model can save upto 70% of the office space costs and other administration costs, which can be used for other programs like employee development etc,
- In contemporary situation, Hybid model can open up doors for wider range of talent groups, help fulfill some of our org strategic goals easily.
- Hybrid model can also help us to attract and retain talent, as it offers more flexibility.

After our teams analysis in last scrum, Hybrid offers win-win situation for everyone. Also, with another paradigm shift in consumer behaviour in travel industry, consumers prefer a call over a personal agents which works more effeciently than before, thanks for our recent extension of customer care unit within ABC media.

--- Letter to Emeritus team on withdrawal ---
Dear Emeritus Team,

I am writing to inform you that of my intention to withdraw from the Global MBA program (28 June 2024 Batch). This decision comes after careful consideration, as the program's structure and evaluation methods did not fully align with my initial learning objectives.

While I appreciate the program's content, I believe a different learning approach that emphasizes practical application and fosters a more engaging evaluation process would be a better fit for my current aspirations.

Given this, I would like to explore alternative options within Emeritus before making a final decision.

To ensure a more informed decision, I would like to request a one-month extension to my current trial period. This would allow me to experience a broader range of course content and evaluation methods. If the program aligns with my aspirations after the extended trial period, I would be happy to proceed with the full program and commit to the next two years.

I understand this may be an unusual request, and if it is not possible, I will have no other option but to withdraw today and look for other similar options.

Thank you for your understanding and willingness to accommodate my request. I look forward to your response.

Best,
Dharmendra Rathod
