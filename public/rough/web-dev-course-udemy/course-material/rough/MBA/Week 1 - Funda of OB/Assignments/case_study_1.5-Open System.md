Case of OB - as it tackles behavioural challenges R.Mishra is facing and creating in the new team.

His suggestions are not entirely wrong, as V.Textiles is trying to live in an closed system which can run them out. Even though they survived with the help of promoters and leadership for more than 20 years, there was no statement of EBITA (profit) earned in 275 crores in FY 2019-20
There is some hope, as the leadership recovered to the pre-pandemic era by June, 2021. 

The challenge is attrition rate may be very low, but the **company is not able to retain experts or the cream layer**
Also, to leverage technology best, there seems like a good scope for advancement as R.M identified, which could result in 10% higher production rate with few changes.

As most of the 

R.M may be competent, but is not happy with the bureacracy. He also shows concern for loosing experts as old leadership cannot work with them as they find it challenging to work with new technology like digital printing, Sustainability factors, virtual samplings, tech fabrics, using smart and novel fabrics, modern supply chain management with virtual collaboration, automation in manufacturing. All these is done, to meet best the current demand in the economy.

Observations:

1. Company is benefitting from the "Loyalty" culture which resulted in lower attritions rate. And higher motivation in older employees. This policy could have worked best in the era, where there was shortage of labour-force in past.
2. To stay relevant, and survive in current market conditions where other companies are focussing on innovation and tech. expertise, `V.T needs newer ideas and experts from across the industry. And newer technology can also attract newer minds in the company.
3. The company is not able to retain experts or the cream layer. This is a big challenge.
