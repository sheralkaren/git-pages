Have you ever wondered why all the companies in the world are targeting the consumers, and in their greed to make their products in your hands, they cross any limits. 

While ethics is enforced within many companies and by govts in many countries at vary level, but we always get news about some companies always highlighted in bad news for scandals or hurting mass with their unhealthy products etc.,

What is not accounted is, yours and mine feelings about certain products. That strong feeling about coca-cola chemicals, that colgate add that tries to fool you and in doing so, no govt can fine them for either they are too small, or they have under the bench settlements. Don't your blood just boil at such news.

Or, when everyone in the companies form a group, to decide what you must pay. Do you have a say in these or never will the like of you will know your power?

As per <policy>, even sheeps have a say in what others can reap with them silently. Without thinking, but effective.

So are we just sheeps for these big companies to rear our labour, and feed us by dominating markets and remove good players.

Every economist knows that, people are the major factor in any govt, any companies life except people. Many of the people don't know their basic rights.

So do you think, we can do sth about it? I think yes, if companies and govt can form as per their will, why not individual groups?

Anyone who is born on this planet, can vote for what they want and what they don't like.
And appeal is the best form of fight, and transparency brings honesty and trust, in any democratic system. Be it govt, or group of people with similar interests. 

Democracies at its max can only be realized when exercised together. This is where is overcome central power to decentral yet effective power to the best of everyone's interests.

Coming back to the topic for today, so, what can we do (all human beings):
- Form a group on social media to have say
- Boycott companies or products based on collective assessments.
- Together, we are recognizable, and can achieve many things (where there is no shame in standing alone, together is strength than can be overridden by the strenght and values of standing alone lion)
- Govt and companies realize the power within the group, and acknowledge their needs.
- Needs a circle of councellors, to direct the groups initiatives 
- Another circle to see the viability of ideas and are respected.
- No mistakes are small, and stepping down is no shame as others in line to work as equal to him / her / them.
- This group, sets an example for holistic living and lives with ethics without which, they will only result in more choas in world.

Groups like this for the first time, can seek what others can't give them.
